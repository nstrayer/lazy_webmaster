A tool writen by a lazy webmaster for the Vanderbilt Graduate Student Council to send out autogenerated emails from a google spreadsheet. 

If your message doesnt get sent out, it's the robot's fault. 

## Usage: 

Go to [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OZofPVq8C6Nfh59OuT0WetSJ4UJNFUxMvWyEufi7JSU/edit#gid=0) and fill out a row with the information for your event you need announcing. 

It will then parse it into valid html to be shoved into a pretty email. 

__Example:__

<h2> Nick Strayer </h2> 
 <p> <a href = 'nickstrayer.me'> This</a> is a test <a href = 'google.com'> message</a> </p>
